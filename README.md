# Mute Mate

**Mutemate** is an intuitive Android application designed to empower individuals
with speech and hearing impairments by bridging communication gaps through
gesture recognition and real-time voice output. By converting hand gestures or
sign language into audible speech using advanced image processing and machine
learning techniques, the app helps users express themselves clearly and
effortlessly.
